# Gnome gym  (working title) is a gym app built using Ionic, React, and Firebase. 

### It is unrelated to the Gnomes in the movie "The Princess Bride" (weird github copilot auto correct). It is also unrelated to the GNOME operating system. It is a gym app.

#### Ultimately the goal of this app is to allow users to complete functional strength training workouts throughout the course of their day, providing gentle reminders and tracking progress. This will be an platform agnostic experience, allowing users to use the app on their phone, tablet, or computer

#### please install appropriate SDK for android, install node, install ionic CLI globally and install xcode for ios. Some brew dependencies are required as well. Refer to ionic getting started documentation for more information. Also, Ionic VS Code plugin is recommended.
